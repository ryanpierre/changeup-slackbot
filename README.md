# changeup-slackbot

## Getting Started

To run the examples in this project and build your own slack bot, you're going to need a few tools.

### Mac

1. Install `iTerm2`. You can use `Terminal` but I would recommend you install iTerm instead.
2. Open iTerm or Terminal and enter the command `/usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"` to install `HomeBrew`
3. In iTerm or Terminal, type `brew install node`
4. Then type `npm i -g wt-cli`

### Windows

1. Install `Powershell`.
2. Choose your OS and install `Node` and `npm` from `https://nodejs.org/en/download/`
3. Then type `npm i -g wt-cli`
